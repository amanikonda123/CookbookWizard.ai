Abstract: The focus of the project is to utilize computer vision to output high-quality recipes from images of food dishes. Users will be able to upload a photo of their meal and be presented with a list of recipes that share many similar traits as the original dish. The project features a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generalize the uploaded photo into one of 251 food classes, and then uses a Doc2Vec word embeddings model to match the class name with recipe names in a separate dataset. The top 10 most semantically similar recipes will then be extracted from said dataset and displayed to the user.
